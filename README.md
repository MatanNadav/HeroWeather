# HeroWeather
  This project is something i wanted to do for a while.
  I wanted a weather app that can show me the place a little bit through photos and videos.
  It was fun making it and didint take too long.
  
  I chose MongoDB as the database for this project because relational db just didint make sense.
  The app stores a list of important cities around the world and only access the API when there is
  no value from the databse.
  
## Project setup
